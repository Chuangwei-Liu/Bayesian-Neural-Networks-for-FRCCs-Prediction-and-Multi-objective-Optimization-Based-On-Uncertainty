# Bayesian-Neural-Networks-for-FRCCs-Prediction-and-Multi-objective-Optimization-Based-On-Uncertainty
* This is my work, applying Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) to Fiber-Reinforce Cementious Composites (FRCCs).
* Bayes-by-Backprop (BBB) model and Monte Carlo Dropout (MC-Dropout) model are both developed.
* The full code will be available once the research paper is published.
